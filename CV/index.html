        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>Firewall Migration</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I developed a Python-based tool with a user-friendly graphical interface using Tkinter. 
                The tool was designed to streamline the migration process for ASA firewall configurations, 
                automating repetitive tasks and drastically reducing the time and effort required for manual migration. </li>

            <li>Additionally, the tool enhanced network engineers' productivity by an impressive 400 times. 
                It achieved this by automating the extraction and conversion of complex configuration data, such as interfaces, 
                NAT rules, and access control lists, while ensuring the output was compatible with the new systems. 
                This approach eliminated errors, improved efficiency, and significantly accelerated the overall migration process.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Policy Automation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I designed and implemented a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) tool to simplify and automate tasks within Cisco Secure Workload. 
                The tool enabled efficient searching, retrieving, and managing of policies, which significantly streamlined operations. 
            <li>By automating these processes, the tool boosted operational efficiency by 150 times, 
                reducing manual workload and improving accuracy in policy management.</li>
        </ul>
